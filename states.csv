The distance is very convenient to the airport, the staff was really nice and accommodating, and perfect that the Inn provides shuttle services at no cost every 30 minutes. The cost for the stay is a good value for all the services that comes with it. I recommend it to anyone even if its for a same day red eye flight and it definitely beats sitting at the airport waiting for your flight! Thanks Pacific Marina Inn for accommodating my family!"",""Greta overall experience. Construction is the only thing I would note worth mentioning as they can keep you up late or wake you up early. Unless you can tolerate loud noises through the walls"",""The first room we were given at this hotel had hair on the toilet and in the bed. The front desk was very helpful and gave us a free upgrade to a family suite since no other rooms were available of the size for which we had paid. They were also happy to come document the hair and inspect the new room for cleanliness before we changed rooms. They do not have a fresh water or a drinking fountain for filling water bottles yet they recommended not drinking the water from the tap. The only option was buying water from the small shop at the hotel. The people who work there are very kind."",""Super close to the airport! Very convenient location. Super pet friendly! Highly recommend if you’re searching for a place that allows dogs! Thanks for letting us stay!"",""Close to the airport, convenient, staff were lovely."",""Very awesome stay! Loved the rooms and very friendly staff! I could not ask for a better stay! The rooms are clean and the beds are soft! You shouldn’t ask for anything else! Mahalo!"",""Good location close to airport and easy shuttle for pickup and drop off. Small rooms but comfy bed for our last night in Hawaii"",""Location was great  quick easy access to the airport."",""Great friendly staff who are there to help you 24/7.  Room was as pictured, included shampoo, body wash, soap and paper towels. However, location isn’t the best, it’s located near the airport in the industrial zone. The hotel is also pretty run down and outdated. There were a lot of construction nearby when I stayed there. So it may not be the most peaceful place to stay. We had a lot of troubles while staying there. Most irritatingly, the waters turned off in the middle of showering, so I was buck naked with soap all over me. I wasn’t able to finish showering until 5 hours later at 4am. Our laundry also malfunctioned 2 times, causing our clothing to smell like sewage. However it is important to point out that the staff did try to help us resolve the problem. They did gave us 6 dollars back for the laundry. And according to the maintenance bro, the construction team nearby accidentally cut the water lines, causing the water to go out. While the staff is helpful, I cannot recommend this hotel. While it’s right next to the airport for those who are staying  overnight, the inconveniences outweighs the benefits. I would not stay here again."",""Loved how close this place was to the airport, and that they had a Chinese restaurant on site as well as a pool! Staff were great at communication and responsiveness. Also got a free shuttle to the airport and back!"",""For the price paid, it was disappointing that the place didnt have a hot shower, it was only warm. They said too many people showering with hot water right now.  The place wasnt as nice as the pictures. Cracks in the grout tiles in shower, lots of old water rot and drywall damages that just got painted over. A/C kept turning off even after the staff came in to fix it.  I guess we just expected better after paying $250 per night. We really liked the location because it was close to the airport and close to the location of our trips purpose."",""Near the airport. Parking lot is not enough"",""Great location if you need to fly early.Was very noisy when we stayed..maybe just bad luck for us."",""Great convenient stay! Close to airport.""]"

Thanks"",""This treehouse is so cute and unique. In the middle of the woods, so gets very dark at night, perfect if there is a meteor shower, which there happened to be for us. They provided lots of cute little snacks. The only thing I was really not a fan of was the bathroom situation. It is porta potty adjacent with SO MANY bugs in the toilet. It made doing our business extremely uncomfortable and we opted to hold everything in because that’s how bad it was. Shower was also less than ideal, and the water would not stay warm. Aside from that though, I definitely recommend this stay to others. It’s definitely one of a kind."",""Well the grandkids loved it, glad we did it. The only think I would say was a negative was the outside house could use some stronger Oder control, and we encountered some large black ants inside the cabin, nothing to alarming to warranty a negative review, it was a cool place the host are amazing really amazing, everyone should experience it."",""A really nice getaway place."",""Fun spot.

Super clean, communicative host and lots of space. Thank you!Thanks Sneha.  Great having you.  Keep in mind that the stars for location are asking if the house was where my listing says it is, not that you wish it were closer to town."",""Tiffany's home is beautifully appointed, and certainly feels more like a home than just a vacation rental.  Four of us, cycling from Buffalo to Albany, stayed at Tiffany's, and very much appreciated the washer/dryer, the offer to use the barn space to store our bikes, and the fire pit.  Most amazing was Tiffany and Mike's graciousness at driving us to town to get some dinner (Uber and Lyft seemingly non-existent) since we didn't want to be biking back to their home in the dark.  A terrific stay, and a beautiful spot in the midst of rolling farm fields.  The acres and acres of sunflowers just up the road were particularly magical."",""Tiffany is an amazing host! We really appreciated her kindness and attention to detail in all circumstances ! She went above and beyond to be sure we had all we needed for a great stay. We stayed at Tiffany's home with our son, daughter in law, and labs. We felt at home from the moment we walked in! We found the spot to be very peaceful out in the farm fields,  yet close enough to activities in town and at the lake. The ample parking was a bonus for us !Thank you so much !"",""Myself and my friends stayed a Tiffany's for a weekend of relaxation and visiting local wineries, breweries and distilleries on Cayuga Lake and we had a fantastic time.  Tiffany was an awesome host who provided everything we needed and more as part of our stay.  As soon as we got to the property we felt the relaxing ambience and the house felt like a home away from home.  Thank you Tiffany, for being a great host and making our stay at your beautiful house so relaxing and convenient!"",""Wonderful stay!  Very comfortable house in peaceful location.  Nearby Stauffer’s market had fantastic baked goods, produce and meat.""]"

The room is clean and comfortable, with modern finishes. The kitchen is well laid out, clean, easy to use and stocked with cookware and appliances in excellent condition.  I love having coffee in the morning on the balcony with hubby and watching the birds come by the bird feeder. The pool is a favorite feature for our kids and when we feel like venturing out, there are quite a few things for us to do close by."",""Absolutely stunning views to wake up to, couldn’t have asked for more scenic surroundings. The place was plenty spacious for a family of 4 and had a full kitchen next door. Highly recommend."",""My partner and I have been searching for accommodations for my birthday weekend and I found David’s cottages and at first I wasn’t so sure how I felt about it, but once you get past the bumpy roads and the crazy hill (don’t drive a low vehicle)  get settled in and embrace the natural beauty around you - it’s nothing short of what’s needed for a peace and relaxing time away from the busy city life. It’s a very natural place, you’ll observe humming birds and woodpeckers near and at a distance. It’s so quiet especially at night time. David is very responsive and helpful. He probably has a instructional video for anything that you may have an issue operating lol. I would definitely stay again!"",""Great place to stay, warm host and very usefull tips to go around !"",""We had a few issues at David's place, some were addressed, some ignored. It looks as pictured but note it's just below the pool and swim training happens in the morning so you hear all that above you. We were only provided 4 towels for 4 guests, no extras for the pool so bring your own. I think it was lacking basic provisions like repellent (lots of mosquitoes and other bugs) and cooking oil. It's not easy to access supplies once you get there because road construction makes going & coming very slow."",""Davids place is beautiful and lays in the middle of the djungle!David is a very responsive host who is very Quick with replies. Her cards about his guests and is eager to find quick solutions to whatever challenges."",""Our stay at David Lee's Airbnb in the heart of the Jamaican forest canopy can only be described as the epitome of tranquility and serenity. The property itself is an exquisite blend of comfort and nature, nestled at the top of the forest canopy, providing breathtaking views and a sense of tranquility that truly encapsulates the essence of Jamaica. The standout feature was undoubtedly the pristine 25-meter pool that was as inviting as it was beautifully maintained. The surrounding natural beauty combined was a true sight. For fitness enthusiasts, the full outdoor gym that looks out to the coast is a dream come true. The location in Port Antonio was ideal for exploring the local area, with a multitude of beaches and hikes. It is worth noting that having a car at your disposal is quite beneficial to freely roam and discover.Overall, this Airbnb is indeed a hidden gem, offering a sublime of tranquility and a unique connection with nature. We couldn't recommend it more highly :)""]"
